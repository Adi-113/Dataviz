## Introduction 
This project, **"Mental Health Assessment"** examines survey data from people around the world, focusing on their mental health history, stress levels, coping methods, and preferences for treatment. The dataset includes details like gender, country, occupation, family health history, treatment status, time spent indoors, stress levels, mood swings, challenges with coping, work engagement, social struggles, and care options.

## How to run the application ?

<ins> **_Step 1:_**</ins>  Download the project zip file from the submission or `git clone` the repository [Dataviz](https://github.com/Adi-113/Dataviz) into your local system.

<ins> **_Step 2:_**</ins>  If you have downloaded the zip file, extract all the necessary files into a designated folder on your system.

<ins> **_Step 3:_**</ins>  To start the application, navigate to the folder containing the `index.html` file, double-click it to open in your default web browser, and you should see your project with a blue circle rendered on the page.

<ins> **_Step 4:_**</ins>  The visualizations will load automatically, allowing you to interact with the charts through dropdown menus, hover effects, and clickable elements to explore various aspects of the mental health survey data. No additional setup is required ‚Äî simply open, explore, and uncover insights!

## Overview of the Visualizations

To explore the data, we have created four visualizations:

### 1. Choropleth Map

- Displays the percentage of individuals experiencing increasing stress, categorized by occupation.
- Helps identify which industries are most affected by stress.

### 2. Pie Chart

- Illustrates the relationship between growing stress and days spent indoors, segmented by occupation.
- Offers insights into how time spent indoors correlates with rising stress levels.

### 3. Clustered Bar Chart

- Examines how individuals with stress and a mental health history are coping.
- Focuses on their struggles with coping mechanisms, work engagement, and social challenges.

### 4. Sankey Diagram

- Visualizes the connection between family history of mental health issues, treatment seeking, and available care options.
- Shows how family history impacts the decision to seek help and access care.

## How to interpret the Visualizations?
## üåç Choropleth Map: Growing Stress Levels Across Occupations

Use our interactive map to explore growing stress levels across countries based on different occupations. 

Use the dropdown menu at the top left to select an occupation, such as **Business**, **Corporate**, **Housewife**, **Student**, or **Others**. Based on the selected group, the map will automatically update to visualize the percentage of individuals reporting growing stress in each country.

A color gradient is applied to the map:
- **Green** ‚Üí Low stress levels (around 0%)
- **Yellow** ‚Üí Moderate stress levels (approximately 25%)
- **Orange to Red** ‚Üí High stress levels (up to 50%)

Darker shades highlight countries where stress levels are more severe within the selected occupation, while lighter shades show regions with lower reported stress.

Overall, the findings highlight that while formal professional sectors like business, corporate jobs, and student populations are heavily affected by stress, mental health awareness is necessary across all occupations to address hidden or emerging stress patterns globally.
