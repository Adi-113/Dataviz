The dataset includes details like gender, country, occupation, family health history, treatment status, time spent indoors, stress levels, mood swings, challenges with coping, work engagement, social struggles, and care options.

## Overview of the Visualizations

To explore the data, we have created four visualizations:

### 1. Choropleth Map

- Displays the percentage of individuals experiencing increasing stress, categorized by occupation.
- Helps identify which industries are most affected by stress.

### 2. Pie Chart

- Illustrates the relationship between growing stress and days spent indoors, segmented by occupation.
- Offers insights into how time spent indoors correlates with rising stress levels.

### 3. Clustered Bar Chart

- Examines how individuals with stress and a mental health history are coping.
- Focuses on their struggles with coping mechanisms, work engagement, and social challenges.

### 4. Sankey Diagram

- Visualizes the connection between family history of mental health issues, treatment seeking, and available care options.
- Shows how family history impacts the decision to seek help and access care.
